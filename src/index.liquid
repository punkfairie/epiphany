<p>Epiphany has moved! I got my own domain a week or two ago and have finally
  finished setting it up and moving Epiphany over. I also updated the layout, so
  it doesn't use frames anymore, keeps things a bit cleaner. I even learned a
  little jquery to do so *shudder*.</p>

<p><a href="https://punkfairie.net/" target="_blank">punkfairie.net</a> now has
  my own personal site on it as well! It's been a looonggg time since I've had a
  personal site, I'm super excited to have a little space again, for whatever I
  feel like posting :)</p>
