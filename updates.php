	<p>New layout is done! I'm super in love with all the pixels, it's so cuuutee.<br>
	I've kept all my old petz in the layout for now because they're so freakin' adorable, and it's
	kind of a nice memorial since they're all long gone by now, lost to the graveyard of past
	computers. Plus I haven't got a chance to breed anymore cuties yet, and I want to try to breed
	every pet I have from scratch as a challenge :)<br>
	<br>
	What else? I've checked all the links, most were broken/inactive so my next project is filling
	the links page back up again. If anyone wants to be sisters lmk in the chat box!<br>
	Adoptions will be up as soon as I can get some breed :)</p>

	<p>HELLO wow I can't BELIEVE I'm writing here, but by a wonderful stroke of luck Megan/Xoops
	(this site's host) found me on Petz Discord and got me the FTP login info for this site, which
	I'd lost LONG ago.<br>
	So here I am! This site will be totally updated sometime in the next few weeks, I'm giddy with
	excitement that I'm able to :D I'd totally written off this site as lost forever!<br>
	<br>
	I play Petz 4 now, so this site will switch over to that game mostly. Maybe some Babyz in the
	future. I've read that Petz 5 tends to be really, really buggy on newer systems and I built my
	computer last year!</p>

	<p>I know there haven't been any updates but I swear Epiphany is still active! Don't expect a
	lot of updates during the school year. During the summers I will update more. And of course I am
	always sending out adoptions! Those don't take much work so that is the only part of Epiphany
	that will be attended to on a regular basis.</p>

	<h2>16 Dec 2014</h2>
	
	<p>Epiphany is officially online! Thank you

	few litters up, and I've just recieved a few more adoptions so expect more in the near
	future!<br>
