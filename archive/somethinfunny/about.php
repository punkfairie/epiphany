	<p>somethin' funny is the crew site of <a href="/" target="_blank">Epiphany</a>! It was opened
	on February 18, 2022.</p>

	<p>The name "somthin' funny" is a name I came up with sometime in middle school - for one of
	my many petz sites I never finished. I've always liked the name though, and it was the title
	of Epiphany's <a href="../images/v1.png" target="_blank">first layout</a>.</p>
